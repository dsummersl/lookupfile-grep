" lookupfile-grep.vim: Lookup files that contain text matches in them.
" Author: Dane Summers (dsummersLa ata yahooa dotta comma (take an 'a' of the

" Last Change: Oct 23, 2008
" Revision: 15
" Requires:
" Vim-7.0
" lookupfile plugin (v 1.4+)
" findutils (find command requires -wholename for 'folder/*/subfolder' type patterns in find command)
" textutils (sed, xargs, etc)
"
" Documentation:
"
" This is a plugin for the lookupfile plugin. It has two usable functions that
" integrate into the lookupfile plugin. Both functions have these basic
" features:
"
"   - The &path and the &suffixesadd are taken into account to determine
"     whether a file should be visible in the drop down list.
"   - To make for quicker file lookups when '*' is part of the search pattern
"     it is treated as if it were '.*' (the probably intent of * by the user).
"   - You can setup whether searches are case sensitive through the
"     g:LookupFileGrep_IgnoreCase setting.
"   - To support changing the path/suffixesadd values on the fly you can use
"     the GrepLookup/CaseLookupFile functions directly (b/c &path and
"     &suffixesadd are settings local to the buffer they are not garaunteed to
"     work with any lookupfile functions if you set &path/&suffixesadd directly.
"
" GrepLookup:
"   The GrepLookup provides a similar feature set to the builtin :grep and
"   :vimgrep provided in Vim, except that it is integrated into the lookupfile
"   plugin. In short: type in a pattern, and any file that contains the
"   pattern is displayed in a drop down.
"
" CaseLookupFile:
"   This function is similar to the default LUPath function provided by the
"   lookupfile plugin, except that it has the standard behavior listed
"   previously (takes &path & &suffixesadd plus '*' converted to '.*', etc).
"
" BunnyCaseLookupFile:
"   Matches files as above, but in addition automatically turns a capital
"   letter search into '\u*' so that you can quickly match agains the capital
"   letters (handy for long java file names).
"
" TODO add the ability to specify whether cache files are temporary or permanent (and if they are
" permanent, then add a function to flush them out.
